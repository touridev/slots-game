# Technical Test Instructions

Welcome to the technical test! Please read the following instructions carefully before starting the implementation.

## Tasks to Complete

1. **Implement all TODOs**
   - The test includes several `TODO` comments throughout the code. Ensure each one is addressed and properly implemented as part of the test.

2. **Reels Implementation**
   - Implement the functionality for reels with **horizontal spinning**. Ensure the spinning logic is smooth, performant, and aligns with the expected behaviour.

3. **Sound Player**
   - Implement the basic **sound player** functionality.

4. **Bonus Points**
   - **Refactoring**: Improve the code structure and maintainability where possible. Follow modern coding best practices to enhance readability and performance.
   - **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests to key parts of your implementation to ensure code correctness and stability.
   - **Consistent TypeScript Code**: Write consistent and idiomatic TypeScript code across all files. Adhere to the project's style guidelines and conventions.

## Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow the principles of clean code. Ensure well-organised, scalable, and reusable code. Add appropriate inline comments and documentation where necessary.

2. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests where applicable. Use a testing framework of your choice (e.g., Jest, Mocha) for these tests.

3. **Tools**:
   - Use the provided TypeScript framework and adhere to its conventions. All code should be written in TypeScript.

4. **Submission**:
   - Ensure all functionality works as expected.
   - Initialise a local Git repository for your project. Ensure your work is committed in incremental and descriptive commits,
   as the Git history will be evaluated.
   - Include any necessary setup instructions in the documentation if additional tools or configuration are required.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on the following criteria:
- Correct implementation of all required tasks (e.g., TODOs, reels horizontal spinning, sound player).
- Code quality, readability, and maintainability.
- Adherence to TypeScript practices and project conventions.
- Bonus points for refactoring, unit tests, and additional enhancements not explicitly required.

## Notes

- Aim for clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
- Do not hesitate to ask questions if any part of the test is unclear.

Good luck, and happy coding!
